# Proposed name: SIG-Java

## Objective

Establish an official communication channel for discussions and suggestions related to the Java TensorFlow client and synchronizing the efforts of the developers contributing to it.

Develop and maintain a new set of high-level utility libraries on top of TensorFlow for ramping up Java ML development and deliver new features faster with their own release life cycle.

## Membership

Everyone interested to promote Java or other JVM-based languages for training, running or serving TensorFlow models is welcome to join the group, whether it is for contributing to the code or simply for proposing ideas. To participate, request an invitation to join the mailing list. Archives of the mailing list will be publicly accessible.

## Resources

* Mailing list: TensorFlow Java Developers (tensorflow-java-dev)
* Repositories: TBD from the outcome of the initial discussions but we have in mind to start up with 
    * `tensorflow-java`: high-level API and utilities on top of TensorFlow Java core client
    * `tensorflow-java-models`: pretrained models from TensorFlow adapted to Java
