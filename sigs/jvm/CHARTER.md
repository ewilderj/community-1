# Proposed name: SIG-JVM

## Objective

Establish an official communication channel for discussions and suggestions related to TensorFlow client in Java or any other languages running on JVMs.

Develop and maintain the TensorFlow Java client and a set of development tools to provide better support for machine learning development on JVM languages.

## Membership

Everyone interested to promote Java or other JVM languages for training, running or serving TensorFlow models is welcome to join the group, whether it is for contributing to the code or simply for proposing ideas. To participate, request an invitation to join the mailing list. Archives of the mailing list will be publicly accessible.

## Resources

* Mailing list: TensorFlow JVM Developers (tensorflow-jvm-dev)
* Repositories: *might change depending on the outcome of the initial discussions*
   * `tensorflow-jvm`: Main repository for new TensorFlow JVM-related projects
      * `tensorflow`: Actual Java client to be moved out of the main repository
      * `tensorflow-utils`: high-level API and utilities on top of TensorFlow Java client
      * `tensorflow-models`: pretrained models from TensorFlow adapted to Java
