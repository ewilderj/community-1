# Request for SIG

## What is this group for?

From the beginning of time, Java has been one of the few languages supported out-of-the-box by TensorFlow, having its own client within its main repository. The initial goal was to support inference of pretrained models on JVM-based platforms, such as Android devices. Thereafter, many contributions were made to make Java a good choice even for building, training and serving models. Now most of the development and evolution of this client is driven by the community.

The purpose of this group is to establish an official communication channel for discussions and suggestions related to the Java TensorFlow client and synchronizing the efforts of the developers contributing to it.

In addition, the group will develop and maintain a new set of high-level utility libraries on top of TensorFlow, in their distinct Git repositories, for ramping up Java ML development and deliver new features faster with their own release life cycle.
