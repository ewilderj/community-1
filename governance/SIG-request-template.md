# Request for SIG

## What is this group for?

From the beginning of time, Java have been selected as one of the few languages supported out-of-the-box by TensorFlow, having its own client within the main repository. The principal goal was to run TensorFlow on the JVM of Android devices for model inference. Then many contributions were made to make it a good choice even for building, training and serving models. Now, its development and evolution pretty much relies exclusively on external contributions.

This purpose of this group is:
* to synchronize the work of developers interested in ramping up Java support in TensorFlow
* to establish a communication channel for discussion and collect suggestions (such as the list of features to be added next)
* to provide new repositories for delivering high-level utility libraries on top of TensorFlow to improve usability

Describe the need the group fills. Who is the audience?
Provide evidence that work is already ongoing in this area.

## Who will be part of it?

* group leader
* a second for the leader
* one or more interested parties who will also be in the group -- provide
  evidence of the sustainability of the group
