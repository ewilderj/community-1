# Request for SIG

## What is this group for?

From the beginning of time, Java has been one of the few languages supported out-of-the-box by TensorFlow, having its own client within its main repository. The initial goal was to support inference of pretrained models on JVM-based platforms, such as Android devices. Thereafter, many contributions were made to make Java a good choice even for building, training and serving models. Now most of the development and evolution of this client is driven by the community.

The purpose of this group is to establish an official communication channel for discussions and suggestions related to the Java TensorFlow client and synchronizing the efforts of the developers contributing to it.

In addition, the group will develop and maintain a new set of high-level utility libraries on top of TensorFlow, in a distinct Git repository, for ramping up Java ML development and deliver new features faster with their own release life cycle.

## Who will be part of it?

* Group leader: Karl Lessard
* Second for the leader: Christian Tsolov

Members of the [unofficial Java group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tensorflow-java-dev-unofficial) might be interested to join this new official one, as the former will not be used anymore.

Anyone also interested to help are invited to join by requesting access to the mailing list, whether they are developers who wants get involve in the code or just individuals who wants to take part of the discussions.

## What initial problems will the group tackle?

* Providing a new set of high-level API and features in Java
    * New repository under the TensorFlow organization will host the code for the new libraries, with their own release dates
    * Features could be merged faster by allowing some members of the community to do code reviews 
* Establish an official communication channel for discussion around Java TF topics
    * Right now, discussions are spread on different channels, such as the unofficial google group or on top of different GitHub issues

## What modes of communication do you intend to use?

* A dedicated mailing list backed by Google Groups
* A Slack channel
* VC calls on Google Hangout could be organized on demand

## Launch plan

1. Exposing the present plan and charter to the community for review
2. SIG set up with initial group members
3. SIG added to community pages on tensorflow.org
4. Leader starts off mailing list discussions about initial work items
5. Inception of the first high-level libraries to be part of the new repository
