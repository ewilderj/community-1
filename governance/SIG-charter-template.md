# Proposed name: SIG-Java

## Objective

Establish an official communication channel for discussions and suggestions related to the Java TensorFlow client and synchronizing the efforts of the developers contributing to it.

Develop and maintain a new set of high-level utility libraries on top of TensorFlow for ramping up Java ML development and deliver new features faster with their own release life cycle.

## Membership

Everyone involved in the packaging, distributing or embedding of TensorFlow is
welcome to join the group. To participate, request an invitation to join the
mailing list. Archives of the mailing list will be publicly accessible.

## Resources

* Mailing list: TensorFlow Java Developers (tensorflow-java-dev)
* Repositories: *TBD from the outcome of the initial discussions* (tensorflow-java, tensorflow-java-models)

## Contacts

* Project lead: Karl Lessard [@karllessard](https://github.com/karllessard)
* For administrative questions, contact Edd Wilder-James [@ewilderj](https://github.com/ewilderj) - ewj at google
